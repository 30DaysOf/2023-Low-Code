title: 3. Use Custom Connector
---

:::info LAB SCENARIO

Working as part of the PrioritZ fusion team you will be configuring a custom connector for an existing API.  The team would like to add badging to the PrioritZ application to give credit to users when they have completed ranking an item.  The team identified an existing API, but it doesn't have a Power Platform connector.  

When you review the API, you see that it has four operations and uses API key authentication.


In **Exercise 3** you will test the custom connector you created using a flow and a canvas application.
