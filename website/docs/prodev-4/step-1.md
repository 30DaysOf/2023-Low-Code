:::info LAB SCENARIO

The team would like to add badging to the PrioritZ application to give credit to users when they have completed ranking an item.  The team identified an existing API, but it doesn't have a Power Platform connector.  

When you review the API, you see that it has four operations and uses API key authentication.
