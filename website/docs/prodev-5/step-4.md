:::info LAB SCENARIO

Working as part of the PrioritZ fusion team you will be configuring a custom connector for a new API you build using Azure Functions. The team has decided to move the logic when a user creates a new ‚Äúask‚Äù to the Azure Function API. This will keep the Power App formula simple and allow more complex logic to be added in the future. In this lab you will create the function, use the Dataverse API, secure the API with Azure AD, configure a custom connector to use the API, and change the Power App to use the connector.

Note: This lab requires an Azure subscription (or trial) in the **same tenant** as your Dataverse environment.



In **Exercise 3** you will deploy the function to Azure.
