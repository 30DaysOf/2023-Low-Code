:::info LAB SCENARIO

Working as part of the PrioritZ fusion team you will be configuring GitHub Actions using the Power Platform Build Tools to automate the teamâ€™s deployments.


In **Exercise 1** you will manually export the Contoso Badges connector solution from the Dev environment and import it to Test environment. You will be doing this promotion manually for this solution so you see how it can be done. However, in a real project it could all be automated using the build tasks you will use in the remaining parts of this lab.

:::info Important
In the interest of time, weâ€™ve only added steps to export the solution as managed.  

It is best practice to also export the unmanaged solution and keep it available for future edits if needed.  

The steps to follow are essentially the same regardless of the exported solution being managed, or unamanged.
