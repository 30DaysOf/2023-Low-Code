## Deploying Sample Apps

Let's deploy the sample apps for this post. Fork [this repository][gh sample] and follow the detailed instruction written on its README to provision and deploy the sample apps. Once everything is done, you will have three [Azure Functions][az fncapp] app instances and one [APIM][az apim] instance.
