Here are the highlights for week 2! If you're new to us, welcome to the party! You won't want to miss the amazing content we have in store for you in this week's [**#30DaysOfLowCode**](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/blog): 

Welcome to our series of blogs on low code development! This series is designed to help you understand the full potential of Power Platform and how it can transform the way you work. This week, our discussions spanned from introducing connectors, dataverse and serverelss apps to testing and constructing your own connector, as well as exploring various integration patterns. So, hang tight and get ready to dive into the exciting world of low-code and integration!

* [**Connectors 101: Let's Make Some Connections!**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day6)

Are you new to connectors and curious about how they can enhance the functionalities of Power Platform? This blog provides a comprehensive overview of connectors and how they interact with data from various services. You'll get a 360 degree view of connectors and understand how they can be leveraged to streamline your work.

* [**Do more with your Data for less - Dataverse!**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day7)

Do you want to create and manage your data and insights with ease to support your applications and more? Our second blog this week provides a walkthrough of Dataverse, from introduction to managing low-code to pro-code integration as well as controlling advanced business logic in a compliant manner.

* [**Serverless Low Code**]((https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day8))

Did you know that you can create serverless applications with low-code technology? Our third blog walks you through how Azure Logic Apps bring low-code technology to serverless computing. You'll learn how to build and deploy serverless applications with ease, leveraging the power of low-code.

* [**Build and Use Custom Connectors**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day9-build)

We also provide hands-on tutorials to help you put your knowledge into practice. Our fourth and fifth blogs [**Build a Custom Connector**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day9-build) and [**Use the Custom Connector**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day9-use) show you step-by-step how to build and consume custom connectors in the Power Platform environment - using a real-world OpenAPI specification and application scenario!

* [**Secure Connectors with Azure API Management**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day10)

Azure API Management is one of the most commonly used tools for custom connectors in the Power Platform. Our sixth blog covers how to add additional security and control to your custom connectors with Azure API Management. You'll learn about different authentication types for custom connectors and how to deploy different authentication scenarios with various sample applications.

* [**Low-Code + Azure Integration Patterns**](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day11)

Last but not least, we end the week with a hands-on approach by showcasing key integration patterns that can elevate your work to the next level. It explores how low-code technology can be combined with Azure to tackle real-world challenges and provide practical solutions. We understand that people learn best from real-life examples, and this blog is designed to do just that.
