Welcome to `Day 13` of #30DaysOfLowCode!

More often than not, a well thought out, consistent, eye-catching but functional user experience can define the success of your app. This is why we’ve decided to dedicate this week to the **User Interface (UI)**. Today’s blog will begin that journey with actionable insights and resources that will get you started building amazing UI with Canvas Apps.

## What are Canvas Apps?

As mentioned in an [earlier blog post](https://microsoft.github.io/Low-Code/blog/2023-day2/#what-does-the-power-platform-provide), Power Apps is a tool for “creating custom applications for web and mobile that can be integrated with a variety of systems and services”. There are two types of Power Apps, namely Model-Driven Apps and Canvas Apps.

Model-Driven apps require a Microsoft Dataverse database. They're built on top of the data that's modelled in that database environment. As a result of this, the views and screens are based on a specific data structure and offer a more consistent appearance and behaviour from one screen to the next.

But with Canvas Apps, you start with a blank screen – like an artist’s canvas. You have complete control over the placement of each image, textbox, form, icon, and other elements on that canvas. Power Apps offers you a graphical, intuitive interface with a pixel perfect visual app designer which enables you to build and deploy professional looking Canvas Apps faster with tailor-made UI.
